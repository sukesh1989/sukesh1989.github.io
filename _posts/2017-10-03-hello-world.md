Hey! I'm Sukesh, an automation tools developer with a Indian messaging startup. My daily work involves writing code mostly using Python, Javascript, Go and Swift. I concentrate on improving the quality and reducing build and release time of both front end and back end applications. Out of my office hours I work on React, Go and Python based projects.

The main motivation (although late) for me to write this blog is [Ryan Bates](https://twitter.com/rbates). I am huge fan of Ryan Bates, During 2010-11 when I came across his website It made me a code monkey. I wrote code whenever I got some free time from college work. I used to love his tutorials, tips and tricks.  I want to help the test and release automation community same way he did for the Ruby and RoR community now. I hope that I will be able to contribute in a small way to improve productivity of my fellow automation engineers and mobile developers.

In this blog I will be sharing my machine learning study progress, scripts and setup related to build and release process automation,  learnings related to [React](https://reactjs.org), [Go lang](https://golang.org), iOS and Android. I hope you will enjoy reading and learning along with me.
